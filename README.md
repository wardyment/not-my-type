# Not my type

A handful of code and comments to get you started on the journey of learning Typescript.

I'm not complicated so neither are these lessons.

They are numbered and should be easy to follow.

# Setup

Make sure you have node and yarn installed on your machine.
Once you have this repo just type following

```
yarn
yarn tsc --watch
```

You should see the directory fill with JS files

You can just run these directly in Node

```
node 1.filename.js
```

If you want to see a bit more info run them in a browser

Just open the index.html file in the fodler and edit the src attribute of the `<script>` tag to point to the correct file e.g "1.filename.js"

Then drag open the file in a browser (prob chrome). You can see the output of the console.log by hitting F12 and clicking on the console tab.

**Good luck**
