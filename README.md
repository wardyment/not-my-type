# Not my type

A handful of code and comments to get you started on the journey of learning typscript.

I get sore eyes staring at docs so I like to experiment and play with things until I understand fully whats happening.

I'm not complicated so neither are these lessons.

They are numbered and should be easy to follow.

# Setup

Make sure you have node and yarn installed on your machine.
Once you have this repo just type following

```
yarn
yarn tsc --watch
```

You should see the directory fill with JS files

You can just run these directly in Node

```
node 1.filename.js
```

If you want to see a bit more info run them in a browser

Just open the index.html file in the fodler and edit the src attribute of the `<script>` tag to point to the correct file e.g "1.filename.js"

Then drag open the file in a browser (prob chrome). You can see the output of the console.log by hiutting F12 and clicking on the console tab.
